And there are very few places I trust for having my sushis, dimsums & UDON Noodles...Papaya is one of the best places according to me if you wanna indulge in some fine dine-in with delicious food. The menu is so massive you can’t choose what to eat and what not to!  The last time I went there I ordered: • DEHYDRATED SPINACH SUSHI: Ik from the name you must be thinking why should I eat spinach that was my reaction as well but the chef recommended us to try that..and trust me it is worth the hype !  • Mushroom Bao: If you’re a mushroom lover these bao are for you...extremely flavourful and quite big in size! • PAD THAI NOODLES: We had to order their infamous pad thai noodles..so tasty with a very different flavour that immediately soothes your taste buds. Also try their Udon Noodles. • CHOCOLATE BALL ON FIRE: The picture says it all..chocolate lovers this is your go to dish ! Though I found it to be a little expensive but you should experience everything right ?\n",

      "Sumitra Rawat 1 Bad quality of food. Never ever go there... It's full of cockroaches and they are visible easily and the food quality is substandard.\n",
      "Iamtarunchhikara 5 The very first thing i liked about this place is the ambience and the live music. They serve really good combination of food and buffet prices and quality are one of the best and affordable in city.\n",
      "FoodisBae 4 Roof top cafe with good view. The interiors are nice and the dj plays good music. Loved the food they serve here. They have amazing buffet also. Pizza,pasta and drinks were pretty good.service was nice.\n",
      "Milind 4 If u are bored of Barbeque nation , this place is must try for u🤓🔥😅. It is one of the best barbeque restaurants in Delhi offering rooftop seating . So we opted for rooftop seating for our lunch & the view was amazing 🔥😻. We opted for veg buffet which included a range of starters like crispy corn , paneer tikka , spicy mushroom . Then in main course we tried manchurian with noodles . As a complementary drink I ordered Kiwi mojito which was so refreshing & eye catchy too😻🔥🔥🔥🤓🤓. So if u visit Pitampura next time don't miss this amazing place.👻🔥🤓😻😻\n"
